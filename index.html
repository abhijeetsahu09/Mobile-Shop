            If you're looking to just listen to music or a few podcasts, the AirPods (2nd generation)
             is a decent choice for iPhone owners, since the connection never drops and total battery life
              is pretty good. You won't get great sound out of these earphones, 
              but that's not the point. If you're willing to sacrifice comfort for convenience, 
            then the second-generation AirPods makes sense.</p>
